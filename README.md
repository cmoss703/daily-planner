# DAILY WORK SCHEDULER

## DESCRIPTION

This webpage was designed to be a daily work scheduler. 

There is a clock on the page showing the current time, and the schedule is colored based on which hours have passed, and what is to come.

When you type something into a time box and click save, the text is saved into the local storage. When you reload the page, your saved text will be shown. When you click clear a box, the text in that box along with the stored data will be cleared, and when you click "Clear Schedule" at the top, all of the local data is cleared.

## WHAT WAS DONE?

The time blocks and buttons are added in the html document, and most of the rest of the work is done in the Javascript document.

A clock is displayed with a time interval showing the exact time at the top of the document. 

The current time is noted, and used to determined whether each time block hour has occurred in the past, is yet to occur in the future, or is the current hour. The boxes are formatted accordingly by assigning a respective class to each one.
